Intro
+++++

For this test, resolution in slice 1 of each of the 2 ACR axial series is evaluated. The following procedure is
repeated for each of those series:

    #. Display the slice 1 image.
    #. Magnify the image by a factor of between 2 and 4, keeping the resolution insert visible in the display.
        This is illustrated in Figure 8.
    #. Begin with the leftmost pair of hole arrays, which is the pair with the largest hole size, 1.1 mm.
    #. Look at the rows of holes in the UL array, and adjust the display window and level to best show the holes as
        distinct from one another.
    #. If all 4 holes in any single row are distinguishable from one another, score the image as resolved right-to-left
        at this particular hole size.

To be “distinguishable” or resolved, it is not necessary that image intensity drop to zero between the holes.
To be distinguishable a single window and level setting can be found such that **all 4 holes in at least one row**
are recognizable as points of brighter signal intensity than the spaces between them. Figure 9a shows the typical
appearance of well-resolved holes.

..warning::

        2.5 Causes of Failure and Corrective Actions

        Excessive image filtering can cause failure. Many types of filtering that are used to make the images appear less
        noisy also smooth the image, which blurs small structures. A site that has failed the high-contrast resolution test
        should check that any user selectable image filtering is either turned off, or at least set to the low end of the
        available filter settings.

        Poor eddy current compensation can cause failure. The scanner’s service engineer should check and adjust the eddy
        current compensation if this problem is suspected

Based on the above excerpt from the ACR Guidance Manual, we just need to find one row in which all 4 dots are high
intensity.

Steps
+++++

    #. Create rectangular ROI.
    #. Window Level (which I implemented for the ACR Low Contrast Object Detectability Task).
    #. Threshold.
    #. Identify center to corner pixel.
    #. Build line profile in this row or column.
    #. Find 4 peaks.
    #. Confirm peaks are spaced out.
    #. Confirm that line is valid.
    #. Stop.
    #. Repeat steps for lower box.
