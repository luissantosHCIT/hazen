ACR Uniformity

https://www.acraccreditation.org/-/media/acraccreditation/documents/mri/largephantomguidance.pdf

Calculates the percentage integral uniformity for slice 7 of the ACR phantom.

This script calculates the percentage integral uniformity in accordance with the ACR Guidance.
This is done by first defining a large 200cm2 ROI before placing 1cm2 ROIs at every pixel within
the large ROI. At each point, the mean of the 1cm2 ROI is calculated. The ROIs with the maximum and
minimum mean value are used to calculate the integral uniformity. The results are also visualised.

        This method gets the mean small rois for the areas of minimum and maximum intensities.

        Below is an excerpt from the ACR Large Phantom Guidance

        For each series, the measurements are made according to the following procedure:

            #. Display slice location 7.
            #. Place a large, circular region-of-interest (ROI) on the image as shown in Figure 15.
                *. The area of the ROI depends on whether the large (200 cm2) or medium (160 cm2) phantom
                    was scanned (Table 4).
                *. This large ROI defines the boundary of the region in which the image uniformity is measured.
                *. Although the mean pixel intensity inside this ROI is not needed for the uniformity test, it is
                    used in the percent signal ghosting test (section 6.0), so it should be noted.
            #. Set the display window to its minimum, and lower the level until the entire area inside the large ROI is
            white.
                *. The goal now is to raise the level slowly until a small, roughly 1 cm2 region of dark pixels
                    develops inside the ROI. This is the region of lowest signal in the large ROI.
                *. Sometimes more than one region of dark pixels will appear. In that case, focus attention on the
                    largest dark region.
                *. In some cases, rather than having a well-defined dark region, one or more wide, poorly defined
                    dark areas or areas of mixed black and white pixels are apparent.
                *. In that case, make a visual estimate of the location of the darkest 1 cm2 portion of the largest
                    dark area should be made.
            #. Place a 1 cm2 circular ROI on the low-signal region identified in step 3.
                *. If measuring in the Medium phantom be sure that this ROI does not include any of the notch at
                the top of the phantom.
                *. Figures 16a and 17a show what typical Large and Medium phantom images look like at this
                    point.
                *. Record the mean pixel value for this 1 cm2 ROI. This is the measured low-signal value.
                *. If there is uncertainty about where to place the ROI because there is no single obviously darkest
                location, try several locations and select the one having the lowest mean pixel value.
            #. Raise the level until all but a small, roughly 1 cm2 region of white pixels remains inside the large ROI.
                *. This is the region of highest signal.
                *. Sometimes more than 1 region of white pixels will remain.
                    In that case, focus attention on the largest white region. It can happen that rather than having a
                    well-defined white region, one ends up with 1 or more diffuse areas of mixed black and white pixels.
                    In that case, make a best estimate of the location of the brightest 1 cm2 portion of the largest
                    bright area.
            #. Place a 1 cm2 circular ROI on the high-signal region identified in step 5.
                *. Record the average pixel value for this 1 cm2 ROI. This is the measured high-signal value.
                *. If there is uncertainty about where to place the ROI because there is no single obviously
                    brightest location, try several locations and select the one having the highest mean pixel value.
